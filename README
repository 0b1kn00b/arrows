Arrows lib released under M.I.T license

Usage.
	//lifts function f and passes output to arrow/function g at completion.
	//start initiates the arrow scheduler
	//can use Arrow.begin();
	
	Arrow.liftF(f).then( Arrow.lift(g) ).run(x).start();

	function (x:){
		return x * 2;
	}.lift().then( g.lift() ).run();
	Arrow.begin();

note: ONLY THE COMBINATORS ARE SUPPORTED, THE SCHEDULING ALGORITHM MAY CHANGE WITHOUT WARNING.

To begin the scheduler, either arrowInstance.start() or Arrow.begin() should be used, 
being that the same name cannot be used for a static function and a class function in the same class. 
GOTCHA
No arrows can be guaranteed to be called after begin() or start() as functionality differs across schedulers 
and platforms, this being the most restrictive case.

DEPENDENCIES
