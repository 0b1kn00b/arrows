Known issues.
some of the classes in arrow.ext are reliant upon classes which are not released anywhre at this time. the port of signals may be released in future but it is more likely that I will move to hsl-1 for the signals implementaton.

I´m not sure the scheduler is completely reliable in terminating automatically, although no test cases have confirmed this yet
